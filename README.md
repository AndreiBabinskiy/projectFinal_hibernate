# projectFinal_hibernate Application
I have worked with various technologies: Hibernate, Redis, Docker, where there is a relational database MySQL with a schema (country-city, language per country). There is a frequent query for cities that is slowing down. The solution is to move all the frequently accessed data to Redis (an in-memory key-value store).
